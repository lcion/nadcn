 *
 *   UNIX Crypt() Implementation
 *   Programmed by Mark Saarinen
 *
 *   If anyone is interested in understanding how the UNIX Crypt() really works, 
 *   I'm posting a 'minium', stripped down version of the Crypt() algorithm.
 *
 *   Personally, I think that the UNIX operating systems should have the Crypt()
 *   implemented like this, with no optimizations (and very little memory
 *   consumption). Fast Crypt()'s are only needed to crack passwords. Do you
 *   want _your_ users cracking passwords? :)
 *
 *   Note that the only change to the DES algorithm is the the entries in the E
 *   (expansion?) table are swapped according to the salt.
 *
 *   This source is available in Pascal too.
 *
 *   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Soon:
 *
 *   ZenKrack (5.5 megabyte buffers and assembly-language optimizations)
 *   in a FTP-site near you..

Network Administrator of Distributed Computer Networks

This application is used when a user needs to monitor multiple computers running on a local network.

The small server (slave) applications are running on the network computers that are required to be monitored. One server instance will be run on each workstation on the network.

The client (Multi Master) application can connect to one or more server on the network, looking for status (ex disk usage) and sending commands (ex shutdown).
